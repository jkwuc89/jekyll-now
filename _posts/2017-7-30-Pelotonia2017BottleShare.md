**[Donate online here](http://pelotonia.org/kwedinger)**

### How Does It Work?

It is very simple!

1. When you come to Fado for my fundraiser, make a donation to my Pelotonia ride. Consider this your "cover charge". I will be accepting cash and check donations at the event as well as online donations
1. Bring along some craft beer to share. This is optional. The more bottles we have to share, the better. All styles are welcome.
1. Enjoy samples from the bottles that everyone brought along. If you get hungry, order some delicious food from Fado. For soccer fans, the 12:30 PM Premier League game will be on.

During the event, I will keep an eye on the donations. When I reach certain donation amounts, I will open the following bottles from my collection:

### [Effectively Documenting your Development Project](https://github.com/jkwuc89/Presentations/blob/master/Effectively%20Documenting%20your%20Development%20Project.pptx?raw=true)
*Presented at [CodePaLOUsa 2016](http://www.codepalousa.com)*

In the most recent Stack Overflow developer survey, poor documentation is cited as the #2 challenge at work for developers. So how does this impact your Agile project? Imagine having your key contributors spending hours or even days each time new developers join your team to bring them up to speed on how to checkout, work with, build and test your project. Or imagine having these key contributors spending valuable time during every sprint answering the same questions about your project over and over again because there is no documentation. This happens today countless times because most development teams do not effectively document their development projects.

So, what constitutes effective development project documentation? The goals are: (1) on-board new team members quickly and as painlessly as possible with minimal assistance from current team members and (2) provide a central repository for answering questions about working with your development project. Come to this session and learn how to effectively document your development project to meet these goals.

### [Hybrid or Native - What Should Be Your Mobile Strategy and Why](https://github.com/jkwuc89/Presentations/blob/master/Hybrid%20or%20Native%20Mobile%20App%20Strategy.pptx?raw=true)
*Presented at [M3 Conference](http://m3conf.com)*

Your organization or business wants to provide a mobile solution to better serve your customers and/or your workforce.  The goal is to reach the widest range of devices possible; but the solution must be developed quickly and cost effectively.  You’ve heard about the hybrid/web approach, pseudo native approaches like Xamarin and their ability to target multiple platforms and you’re intrigued.  You've also heard that native provides a better user experience and higher performance. This session will kick off by giving an overview of the popular available approaches, using my architecture and development experience at clients who have utilized these approaches to solve their mobile business needs. This will level set the knowledge of the attendees and allow everyone to have a good understanding of the available approaches. We will then have an open and collaborative discussion on the pros and cons of each approach. You will leave this session better informed and with information that will help you and your organization decide which approach is best for your mobile solution needs.

### [Implementing Push Notification Support in your Android Application](https://github.com/jkwuc89/Presentations/blob/master/Implementing%20Push%20Notification%20in%20Android.pptx?raw=true)
*Presented at [CodeMash](http://www.codemash.org), [M3 Conference](http://m3conf.com) and [That Conference](https://www.thatconference.com)*

Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) is a free service that allows you to send data from your server to your Android application.  This can be lightweight messages telling your app there is new data to be fetched from your server or it could be a message containing up to 4kb of payload data. This demo intensive session will walk you through the steps necessary to implement push notification support using GCM inside your Android app. The GitHub repository for this session will be made available beforehand so feel free to bring along your laptop to walkthrough the demos during the session. The following topics will be discussed and demonstrated.

Prerequisites, Set Up Google Play Services SDK, Create Google API Project, Get a Google Service Configuration File,
Add Google Play Services Library,
Update the App's Manifest,
Check for Google Play Services Availability,
Register Your App with GCM,
Implement Services,
Process Notification Data in Activity,
Testing Without a Server,
Test API Key and Registration ID,
Additional Info and Questions

### [Real World Mobile App Development Using Phonegap](https://github.com/jkwuc89/Presentations/blob/master/RealWorldMobileAppDevelopment.pptx?raw=true)
*Presented at [M3 Conference](http://m3conf.com) and [StirTrek](http://stirtrek.com)*

You made the choice to use PhoneGap and web based technologies to develop your mobile app. You worked through the platform guides and now, you are ready to take the next step. This session will cover the essential web based technologies, the frameworks and the tips, tricks and techniques to develop and deliver a PhoneGap based mobile app that runs on Android and iOS. You will leave this session with the information necessary develop and deliver a real world mobile app using PhoneGap. The following topics will be discussed and demonstrated.

Effective use of PhoneGap's command line tools with IDEs to develop and build your app,
Delivering iOS and Android apps using the same project and code base,
Data management with JSON, HTML5 local storage and SQLite,
Effective binding between your HTML and your data,
Managing arrays, collections, functions and Ajax requests,
Reusable HTML rendering templates,
Globalization using jquery / globalize and i18n,
Adding push notification support,
Must have add ons and libraries including digital signature support,
Debugging, testing, performance, lessons learned and gotcha's

### [A Swift Introduction to Swift (pun intended)](https://github.com/jkwuc89/Presentations/blob/master/A%20Swift%20Introduction%20to%20Swift.pptx?raw=true)
*Presented at [M3 Conference 2016](http://m3conf.com)*

 - [Xcode Playgrounds with presentation code](https://github.com/jkwuc89/SwiftPlaygrounds/tree/master/Swift%20Introduction%20to%20Swift)

Swift is Apple's innovative programming language for Cocoa and Cocoa Touch. Coupled with Xcode, it is now the ideal way to develop your iOS mobile app. Instead of pouring through a bunch of slides with code samples sprinkled in, this pre-compiler session will be hands on. Bring your Mac laptop with Xcode 7 installed and  we'll walk through developing an iOS app using Swift. Along the way, we'll work through all the necessary language syntax including types, operators, control flow, functions, closures, collections, classes, properties and methods. We'll use auto layout inside Xcode to lay out the user interface for our app. We'll also attempt to demystify the world of optionals. The material and checkpoints for this session will be posted on GitHub prior to the start of this session. This pre-compiler is for developers experienced with an object oriented language like Java or C#. Previous experience with Xcode is helpful too but not required.

title: Welcome to my new blog!

Welcome to my new blog which I got up and running very quickly
using this [excellent startup guide](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) by Barry Clark.
If you interested in starting your own blog using Jekyll with easy hosting on GitHub,
be sure to check out the link above.

So, what am I going to write about? My primary focus will be
software development, strongly influenced by what I am 
currently working on or what I will be presenting on in the near future.
Occassionally, I will also share my thoughts on craft beer, football (soccer), 
and my travels with my wife.

Feel free to reach out to me using my About page (link is above).

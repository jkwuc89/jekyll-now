I am a Principal Consultant with [Improving](http://www.improving.com/). I have over 26 years
experience architecting, designing, developing and delivering high quality software solutions
for several companies including Diebold, IBM, Lexmark, Limited Brands, Ohio State, and Sterling Commerce.
I am currently very passionate about architecting and developing software solutions that deliver
exceptional ROI to my clients. I have presented at CodeMash, Code PaLOUsa, Columbus Code Camp, M3,
Path to Agility, StirTrek, and That Conference. When not at work, I enjoy craft beer, dining
and traveling with my beautiful wife Karen and spending time when I can with my two daughters
who are currently away at college.
